## The Challenge: Climate Models Need Baselines

**The Problem:**

- Earth System Models project future climate & ecosystems
- Models require robust baselines for validation
- Contemporary data = limited temporal scope
- Lack of long-term ecosystem dynamics

## Solution? Palaeoecology

- **Spatial coverage**: Global (with regional biases)
- **long-term records**: Decadal to millennial scales
- **A window to the past**: Pre-anthropogenic baselines

**But:** Heterogeneous data quality, taxonomies, chronologies...

## The Data Revolution in Paleoecology

### Neotoma Paleoecology Database

- Open-access infrastructure
- Expert-curated data
- Standardized metadata
- Community-driven governance

**Challenges remain:**

- Heterogeneous taxonomies
- Variable sampling density
- Spatio-temporal uncertainty

## FOSSILPOL: Reproducible Workflows

## The FOSSILPOL workflow

**From heterogeneous data to systematic comparisons**

**Key Components:**

1. Automated quality control
2. Data cleaning & harmonization
3. Chronological modeling (Uncertainty propagation)

**Enables:**

- Reproducible workflows
- Transparent data-processing methodology
- Continental-scale syntheses
- Like-for-like regional comparisons

## The FOSSILPOL workflow

## Computational infrastructure

TODO: add info about the progress of computational power and cost

## Statistical Innovation

TODO: add details from Erin Dillon's paper about computational paleoecology

TODO: mention the Gavin's talk

## Detecting Rate of Change

**RRatepol: An R package for Rate of Change analysis**

- Quantifies temporal variability in assemblage composition
- Detects periods of rapid change
- Handles uneven time series
- Propagates uncertainty

**Reference:** Mottl et al. (2021) *Quaternary Science Reviews*

TODO: add figure showing a step by step estimation of RoC from pollen data

- sample-to-sample
- binnin
- Moving window
- Uncertainty propagation

## Global Synthesis: Science RoC Paper

- Global patterns of vegetation change
- The payoff of big data + reproducible workflows + statistical tools

**Reference:** Mottl & Flantua et al. (2021) *Science*

TODO: add figure showing data distribution

TODO: add figure showing building step-by-step the global RoC patterns

## Continental Patterns: Asia Case Study

- we do not have to stop at single ecosystem property

TODO: redraw the main figure with proper axis

**Reference:** Bhatta et al. (2023) *Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution*

TODO: add refremce to Bryan's poster

## Latitudinal Gradients in Phylogenetic Assembly

- we can move beyond taxonomic diversity

TODO: add figure form the paper? is the data available?

**Reference:** Bhata et al. (2024) *Scientific Reports*

## Functional Trait Integration

- beyond taxonomic diversity - functional ecology

- Taxonomic identity ≠ ecological function
- Link to environmental drivers
- Trait-environment relationships
- Bridge to contemporary ecology

**Reference:** Brown et al. (2023) *Functional Ecology*

TODO: add refremce to Naty's poster

## Putting everything together

- indidual data sources are scattered and heterogeneous
- we need integrated databases and tools

### VegVault

**Reference:** Mottl et al. (2025) *Scientific Data*

TODO: add slides about:

- the content of database
- assebly process
- {vaultkeeper} usage (Denmark data?)

---

## Layering in Human Impacts

### When do humans start to matter?

- add AI generated figures (hunting, agriculture, industry)

## Holocene: Climate vs Human Effects

TODO: add a steo-by-step showing the results for Europe (tranpose the data into 0.5  = 0; human <0> climate)

**Reference:** Felde & Mottl & Flantua et al. (preprint)

## Planetary Boundaries Framework

## From Paleo-Reconstruction to Policy

**Planetary Boundaries provide:**

- Conceptual framework for "safe operating space"
- Biosphere integrity & land-system change
- Need for historical ranges of variability

**Reference:** Gillson et al. (2025) *Global Change Biology*

TODO: decide which figure to inlcude? Figure 2 is probably the best

## Summary

- Paleoecology offers long-term baselines
- Big data + reproducible workflows + statistical tools
