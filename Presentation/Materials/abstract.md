# Estimating Vegetation Change from Fossil Pollen to Planetary Boundaries: A Global, Long-Term Synthesis Using Big Data

Reproducible, large-scale syntheses of fossil pollen now enable a genuinely global perspective on how terrestrial vegetation has reorganised from the late Pleistocene to the present—and how these dynamics can inform today’s ecological baselines and sustainability policy.
Leveraging thousands of publicly available pollen time series, we outline a shift towards more reproducible workflows. We introduce FOSSILPOL, which couples expert-led data governance from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database with automated, project-specific quality control (cleaning and harmonisation), updated chronological modelling, and uncertainty propagation. The framework supports systematic, like-for-like comparisons across regions and studies, addressing long-standing challenges posed by heterogeneous taxonomies, variable sampling densities, and spatio-temporal uncertainty.

We highlight how recent statistical advances and increased computational power allow the distillation of complex palaeoecological time series into interpretable summaries of macroecological change—capturing multi-scale trends in diversity, composition, and rate-of-change. Crucially, we demonstrate how fossil pollen assemblages can be integrated with complementary datasets—such as plant functional traits and climate reconstructions—to move beyond taxonomic patterns towards holistic ecosystem properties and their drivers through time. This integration bridges palaeo- and neo-ecology, yielding robust, scale-aware baselines against which current trajectories can be assessed.

Viewed through the lens of ‘planetary boundaries’, long-term reconstructions help constrain historical ranges of variability for biosphere integrity and land-system change, clarifying where management might seek to resist, accommodate, or adapt to novel states. We conclude by outlining community priorities for a data-rich, macroecological palaeoecology: interoperable standards, open workflows, rigorous uncertainty handling, and tighter links to modelling and decision-making. This agenda positions quantitative palaeoecology as a cornerstone for contextualising—and governing—the present climate and biodiversity crises.
